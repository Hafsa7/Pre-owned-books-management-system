# Pre-owned-books-management-system
The “PRE-OWNED BOOKS MANAGEMENT” system has been developed to override the problems in the manual systems.The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors and to provide a reliable and fast management system.The aim is to satisfy the user requirements and have a good user interface.It will help the students in better utilization of resources that are available within the college.The user can either login as a buyer or a seller by entering their college code and their respective USN.The seller can sell their books which can be bought by their juniors who can view the books according to their branches and semesters.Thus trying to eliminate the middleman in the second hand business by connecting the students of the same college,hence making the task easier.


## informal explanation of project(problem statement)


  Generally we buy new textbooks and use them for very short time and then sell them to some random second hand book seller.The very same books will be brought by 
  juniors for some extra price.If those same books are required for juniors,why not we exchange right here in college campus itself,rather than getting the same 
  books for extra price. 
  The idea here is simple,that is circulating those textbooks within the collge eliminating the middlemen involved in second hand books business.
  The students after completing their exams/courses can come to a platform where they can sell their textbook providing some details.Anyone can login as seller or
  buyer and sell/purchase their books.
  
  we also added handwritten notes,handwritten notes are getting in demand as they have more readability features.These notes will help students during their course
  examinations as they contain excatly what to learn and expect in examinations.These handwritten books are added by sellers,interested buyers can purchase these notes.
  
  Important thing here is since its a idea of circulating books within college,there is no need of transportation here.
  
  We can organize books accoriding to semester,college,branches so that they can find their books easily.
  
  The sellers and buyers are awarded points based on their purchases/sellings.
  
  Sellers and buyers history is recorded and also the availbale books and sold books are updated after each purchase.
